                    <p>To write a story on Bloggger, you'll need to set up a user account and sign in to Bloggger.
                    Once you're logged in, you can click on your user icon in the bottom
                    right corner.After adding a blog title you will see the Bloggger editor, which looks like this:</p>
                    <img className="textboxImg" alt="Img"/>
                  </div>
                  <div className="content">
                    <p>
                      Anyway, let's not get hung up on content for right now. To publish your story on Bloggger,
                       click on the "Publish" button in the bpttom right corner.
                       In its most basic form, a blog on Bloggger consists of a title and a body text.
                       (And, of course, it can get quite a lot more complex than that.)
                       You do have to include a bit of text before you'll be allowed to publish
                       (i.e., you cannot publish an empty story).For now, we'll keep things simple

                    </p>

                </div>
              </div>
              <div className="col-md-5 col-sm-12">
              </div>
            </div>
          </section>
        </Card>
      </div>
